Problem statement
Create a meal app to store and search meals. Use ONLY vanilla javascript, no libraries or frameworks allowed for Javascript (you can use any css framework like Bootstrap).

Features (No need for extra features, just make the listed features)
Home Page
Search any meal from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions).
Each search result of the meal should have a favourite button, clicking on which the meal should be added to “My favourite meals” (a list).
On clicking any particular search result (any meal), open a new page with more information about that meal(meal page)

Meal Detail Page
Should show information about the meal like its name, photo, instructions, etc (these are must, rest you can add if you want).

In this web app you can search for any food. when you press any key on keyboard all food listed below the search box related to that food.
you can click on more details button and see the recipe details, image.
you can add that food in your favourites meal list by clicking on like button.
you can also remove food from your favourite meal list.
